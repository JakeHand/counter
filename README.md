# Javascript Counter Project
After completing a majority of the Codecademy front end engineering course I have decided to venture off into a few projects of my own.

This is a very simple counter project where I used Javascript event listeners to increase and decrease a number.

This is my first step in many in continuing to understand how Javascript is integrated with HTML and CSS.
